# RISC-V-To-LaTeX
Converts RISC-V assembly to LaTeX. I needed to insert a lot of assembly into an assignment. I wanted the assembly to be highlighted so it is nicer to read. I thus created this simple java program.

To use it just put your assembly into the assembly.txt and run the program. The program will generate highlighted assembly in LaTeX in the output.txt file.
